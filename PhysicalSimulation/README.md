# Physical Simulation
This section showcases physics-oriented simulations. 

Pending publication permission, I hope to include compuatational astrochemistry work regarding the reionization period of the early universe, in progress under the direction of Dr. P. Stancil. Related work for which I have received authorship credit is available [here][1].

## [Adapted From PhET](./AdaptedFromPhET/)
This directory contains an adaptation of a [PhET][2] simulation for vector addition. The project involved editing the original source code and recompiling into an .html document. This was completed in order to improve the validition of the simulation as a replacement for in-person lab instruction due to COVID-19 restrictions. 

## [Particle Simulation](./ParticleSimulation/)
This PyGame project sets out to simulate two-dimensional collisions between numerous particles in a box. The simulation considers effects such as elasticity, gravity, and drag. A [QuadTree](./ParticleSimulation/QuadTree.py) algorithm is implemented in order to speed up processing and allow for a greater number of particles to be simulated simultaneously.
