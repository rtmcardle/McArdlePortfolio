# Physical Simulation
This section showcases physics-oriented simulations. Currently, only the project [Particle Simuilation](ParticleSimulation/) is available. 

Pending publication permission, I hope to include compuatational astrochemistry work regarding the reionization period of the early universe, in progress under the direction of Dr. P. Stancil. Related work for which I have received authorship credit is available [here][1].
