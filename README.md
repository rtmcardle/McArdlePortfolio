# Ryan McArdle Portfolio

This repository showcases programming work completed and maintained by Ryan McArdle. Each directory in the repository contains codes which focus on a given field of application. The bulk of the code is written in Python. For a sample of Java code, please check the [Search and Logic](SearchAndLogic/) directory.

## Directories

The contents of the various directories are as follows:

### [Automata](Automata/)
This directory contains an [Automandala](Automata/Automandala/) class which allows for the exploration of various cellular automata evolution rules and the various patterns than are created when plotted in two dimensions.

### [Data Mining](DataMining/)
This directory showcases predictive models and data management. Contained are classification and regression solutions that employ a range of methods including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Perceptrons, and Naive Bayes.

### [Evolutionary Computation](EvolutionaryComputation/)
This directory contains evolutionary optimization programs. Both [genetic algorithm](EvolutionaryComputation/GeneticAlgorithms) and [evolutionary strategy](EvolutionaryComputation/EvolutionaryStrategies) approaches are provided. This folder also contains a copy of the Boid Evolution group project; the original repositoy can be found [here][1].

### [Fractal Geometry](FractalGeometry/)
This directory contains a class capable of drawing a number of fractals utilizing the Python [turtle][2] library. The bulk of these algorithms are derived from Gerald Edgar's [Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry][3].

### [Physical Simulation](PhysicalSimulation/)
This directory contains a particle simulation which employs a QuadTree method in order to handle a significant number of particles. Additional simulations are expected to be added in the near future.

### [Search and Logic](SearchAndLogic/)
This directory contains solutions to a range of problems that employ search based artificial intelligence methods, including A* and MiniMax. These solutions are based on the [codebase][4] associated with Russel and Norvig's [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach][5]. This directory features work written in Java.
